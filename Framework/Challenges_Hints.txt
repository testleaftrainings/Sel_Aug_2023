Automation Challenges in Selenium: Can interact only with browsers
----------------------------------
1. Can not interact with Window dialog box
		- Use sendKeys() to attach the file without interacting with window dialog
		
2. Can not able to interact with the WebElements using selenium methods
		- Use java script code for interaction
		
3. Captcha 	/ OTP
		1. We can ask the developement team to have a static value for captcha / OTP ( abcde / 1234)
		2. We can ask the development team to disable the captcha / OTP in the automation environment
		
4. StaleElementRefernceException
		Refer Interview Questions in EdTech platform

5. Dynamic Data for the testcases
